Beckman Coulter automation platform files for automated Illumina Nextera XT library preparation, including gDNA extraction and Qubit quantification. Files cannot be opened without appropriate software, so screenshots are included for quick inspection. It is unlikely that these files are usable in a plug-and-play fashion; they are best utilised as a guide to replicate protocols on other automation platforms.

Generally, the most recent version of these files should be viewed/used; older versions are kept for reference. Any enquiries can be directed to chin@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk or kliu@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk.
