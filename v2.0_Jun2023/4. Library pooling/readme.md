Libraries can be quantified using the Qubit quantification method, and allsamples.csv is processed using the included R script. 

Outputs tff_library_pool.csv and manual_library_pool.csv to account for larger variations that the automation platform is less well suited for pipetting (e.g. <0.6 ÂµL)

tff_library_pooling.csv is then read by the .bmf file.
