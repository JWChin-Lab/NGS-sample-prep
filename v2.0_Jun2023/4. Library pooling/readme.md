Libraries can be quantified using the Qubit quantification method, and allsamples.csv is processed using the included R script. 

Outputs a tff library pooling.csv and manual library pooling.csv to account for larger variations that the automation platform is less well suited for pipetting (e.g. <0.6 ÂµL)

tff_library_pooling.csv is then read by the .bmf file.
